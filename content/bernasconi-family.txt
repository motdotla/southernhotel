<strong>Bernardo Bernasconi</strong>
<p>
Bernardo was a Swiss immigrant coming to America by a windjammer (no engine) around Cape Horn in 1859. Once he arrived in California he traveled for many years in search of a place to build. He ended up settling and purchasing 284 acres near what is now Lakeview. 
</p>

<p>
The land ran along the San Jacinto river and was part of a Mexican land grant. He lived in a small, one roomed adobe house which was more than enough for Bernardo’s simple lifestyle. However, once he met Marcellina Orsi (also a swiss immigrant) on a trip to San Francisco, plans changed as Marcellina and Bernardo were happily married in September 1883. Marcellina found Bernardo’s adobe hut not up to par with her comfort needs; therefore, she set out for a better home. The Bernasconi’s were then the owners of a ten room brick house and a pleasant hotel in the city of Perris.
</p> 

<p>
They had six children, Matilda, Felicita, Joseph, Ernest and twins Stella and Edith. They all moved into the hotel as a private residence in 1901, in order to be closer to the schools, as Marcellina thought highly of a good education.

<strong>Marcellina Bernasconi</strong>
<p>
Marcellina was born in Switzerland, being one of sixteen children. However, at the age of ten years, Marcellina was deprived of a mother’s loving care due to her mother’s death. 
</p>

<p>
This only made her stronger, as being the ambitious woman she was, she came to America, arriving in New York City in 1877. She remained there for approximately a year and a half, and then migrated to San Francisco, joining her older brothers and becoming a governess . She lived in San Francisco for the next four years, and met Bernardo. They fell in love, and the couple married on September 1, 1883.
